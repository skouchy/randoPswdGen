Random Password Generator

## Description
A simply designed webpage with the ability to generate a randomized password at the "click" of a button. Users will first be prompted to choose the length of their Password with a required minimum of 8 characters and max of 128. Once length is determined, the user will be able to confirm or decline a series of options to include lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and/or special character-types - but they must choose at least 1! Immediately after input results are submitted, a randomized set of characters, of a [valid] desired length, are displayed in the once blank text area, just above the red "Generate Password" button.
